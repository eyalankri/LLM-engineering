## üì¶ Requirements

Each project includes its own `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`.

---

## üîê .env File

Each project uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys. This keeps secrets out of your codebase and lets you load them securely using the `dotenv` package.

Example `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
cd project-name
conda activate llms
jupyter lab
```

Make sure you add a `.env` file in each project with your API keys.
